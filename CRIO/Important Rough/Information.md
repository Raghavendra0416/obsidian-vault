Time complexity:
We only use Big O to show the worst case because if we provide the best case directly they don't know it is the best case.

Binary Search:
Where they can be used?
Ans: they can be used when there is a need to **find the value** or if there is a need to **minimize or** **maximize the value based on a certain condition.**

Bubble Sorting:
Sort the array using swapping the big element

we will check every element and if the element is big than next element then we have to swap the element and small element with big element, and we will do the same for the whole array.


##### About Images:
- Images display at their **intrinsic (original) pixel size**, ignoring the parent `div`'s width and often overflowing it. you must explicitly tell the **`<img>` tag** to fit the container.
	```CSS
	for image we need to:
	.className img{
		width: 50px;	
	}
	```
- While using flex, grid for images or any other elements. the images should be in child or else. images won't be effected by grid. 
	  CSS Grid: **The "Direct Child" Rule.** - same for flex.


### Another:
- Grid & Flex follows - **Direct Child Rule.**
