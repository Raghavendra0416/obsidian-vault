Time complexity:
We only use Big O to show the worst case because if we provide the best case directly they don't know it is the best case.

Binary Search:
Where they can be used?
Ans: they can be used when there is a need to **find the value** or if there is a need to **minimize or** **maximize the value based on a certain condition.**

Bubble Sorting:
Sort the array using swapping the big element

we will check every element and if the element is big than next element then we have to swap the element and small element with big element, and we will do the same for the whole array.
