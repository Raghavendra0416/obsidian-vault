symbol, multiple same names in a single object, TLE, continue, break, time complexity (upper bound(represented by  'O'), lower bound(represented by Theta-'**θ**'), tight bound(represented by Omega- Ω)) , space complexity, Arrays, Objects, Maps, sets. Arrays, String, Substring, Subsequence, Binary search, usage of two pointers in different programs to reduce the time & space complexity(DSA), Recursion, 


Session 8:
when accessing keys in maps when do we have undefined as output? Reason? 

Sorting Algorithms:
Bubble sort, Selection sort, insert Sort, merge sort

what is binary search? and where do we use binary search(2 places)?
