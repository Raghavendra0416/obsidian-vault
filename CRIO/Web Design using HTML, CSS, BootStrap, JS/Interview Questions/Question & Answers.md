#### Where do we defiantly need to use Inline styling?
Answer: Loader.

Why do we have to provide In-line styling to loader instead of Internal/External styling?
Answer: 
If we use Internal/External styling the browser has to download the file, render the file and execute the file. But if we use In-Line Styling the browser has to download and execute the file.

#### What Styling has more priority?
Answer: 
In-Line Styling(has more) > Internal Styling (Less compared to in-line & greater than external)> External Styling (less compared to in-line & Internal)

Above all  if !Important is used then that will have high priority.
