What is wireframe?
Why do we use wireframe and why do designers use wireframes?
What is Low-fi and High-fi?
How do we create a wireframe?
Example for wireframe.

### What’s a wireframe?
Think of a wireframe like a **blueprint for an app or website screen**.  
It’s a quick, simple drawing that shows **where things go** (header, menu, buttons, forms) and **how you move** from one screen to another. No colors, no fancy fonts—just boxes, labels, and arrows.

### Why designers use wireframes

- **Fast & cheap**: you can sketch 5 ideas in minutes.
- **Focus on the idea**: people react to the _flow_ and the _layout_, not the colors.
- **Easy to change**: erasing a box is way easier than redoing polished screens.

### Low-fi vs High-fi (plain English)

- **Low-fidelity (low-fi)** = rough sketch. Boxes, scribbles, placeholder text.
- **High-fidelity (high-fi)** = polished mockup. Real fonts, colors, spacing, near-final look.  
    Start low-fi to nail the concept, then go high-fi when the flow feels right.

### What’s in a wireframe?

- **Boxes** for sections (header, content, sidebar)
- **Lines** for text (titles, labels)
- **X’d rectangles** for images
- **Circles/rounded boxes** for buttons
- **Arrows** to show navigation between screens
- Tiny **notes** if something needs explaining

### A super simple example (To-Do app)

Imagine the first version of a to-do app. Here’s a low-fi wireframe you could draw on paper:

```
[ To-Do ✔ ]                       ← Header/Title

[ + Add task ]                    ← Primary action

[ □ Buy milk          > ]         ← List item (tap “>” to open details)
[ □ Call mom          > ]
[ □ Finish report     > ]

( bottom nav:  [Home] [Stats] [Settings] )
```

Tap a list item to open a details screen:

```
[ Task Details ]

Title: [ Finish report           ]
Notes: [ ...                     ]

[ Mark as Done ]   [ Delete ]
< Back
```

Checkout flow example (shopping cart) would be the same idea: a list screen → item details → cart → checkout, each as quick boxy sketches with arrows between them.

### How to make your first wireframe (5-minute recipe)

1. **Pick a task**: e.g., “Add a to-do”.
2. **List the screens**: List → Add Task → Confirmation.
3. **Sketch each screen** with boxes and labels (no color).
4. **Add arrows** to show what happens on tap/click.
5. **Ask 3 questions**: Can users see what to do? What’s the main action? What’s missing?

### Example:

A simple **Habit Tracker** app. it’s just boxes, labels, and arrows so you can see layout + flow without any styling.

#### 1) Home / Today

```
[ HABITS — Today ]                      ← Header

[ + Add Habit ]                         ← Primary action

( ) Drink Water        [Log]  (…)
( ) 10-min Walk        [Log]  (…)
( ) Read 5 pages       [Log]  (…)

---------------------------------------
[ Home ]   [ Stats ]   [ Settings ]     ← Bottom nav
```

#### 2) Add Habit

```
[ Add Habit ]          [Save]

Name:        [ ____________ ]
Frequency:   [ Daily  v ]            ← Could be Daily / M–F / Custom
Reminder:    [ On/Off ]  Time [07:00 v]
Goal/Notes:  [ ____________ ]

< Cancel
```

#### 3) Habit Details

```
[ Drink Water ]        [Edit]

Streak: [ 3 days 🔥 ]                 ← Simple streak indicator
History:
[ M T W T F S S ]
  ✓ ✓ ✓ - - - -

Reminders: [07:00] [12:00]
Actions: [Log today]  [Skip]  [Delete]

< Back
```

#### 4) Stats

```
[ Stats ]

[X] Weekly completion chart            ← Big box = chart placeholder
      0%     50%     100%

Top habits:
- Drink Water        85%
- 10-min Walk        60%

< Back
---------------------------------------
[ Home ]   [ Stats ]   [ Settings ]
```

#### Flow (how screens connect)

- **Home → Add Habit:** tap **“+ Add Habit”**
- **Home → Habit Details:** tap a habit row or **(…)**
- **Habit Details → Home:** **Back**
- **Home → Stats:** bottom nav **Stats**
- **Add Habit → Home:** **Save** (creates habit) or **Cancel**

#### What to test with this wireframe
- From **Home**, is the main action obvious? (Add or Log)
- In **Add Habit**, are the few fields enough to start quickly?
- In **Details**, can users see streak + history at a glance?
- In **Stats**, do users understand their progress?
