| 1. Built-in Methods        | Array.sort()             | JavaScript's native sorting method that converts elements to strings and sorts in ascending order by default |
|                            | Array.toSorted()         | Creates a new sorted array without mutating the original array, introduced for immutable operations          |
|                            | Custom Compare Functions | Functions passed to sort() methods to define custom sorting logic for numbers, objects, and complex data     |
| 2. Basic Algorithms        | Bubble Sort              | Compares adjacent elements and swaps them if in wrong order, repeating until array is sorted                 |
|                            | Selection Sort           | Divides array into sorted/unsorted regions, repeatedly selects smallest element from unsorted region         |
|                            | Insertion Sort           | Builds sorted array one element at a time by inserting each element into correct position                    |
| 3. Intermediate Algorithms | Merge Sort               | Divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits array into halves, sorts each half, then merges them back           |
|                            | Quick Sort               | Selects pivot element, partitions array around it, then recursively sorts the partitions                     |
| 4. Advanced Algorithms     | Heap Sort                | Converts array to binary heap structure and repeatedly extracts maximum element                              |
|                            | Counting Sort            | Non-comparison algorithm that counts occurrences of each distinct element                                    |
|                            | Radix Sort               | Non-comparison algorithm that sorts by processing digits from least to most significant                      |
