Sorting Techniques:
Algorithms which has Time Complexity: O(n^2):
- [x] Bubble Sort
- [ ] Selection Sort
- [ ] Insertion Sort

Optimal Algorithms:
- [x] Merge Sort 
- [ ] Quick Sort

Easy to learn:
- **Bubble sort** — typically taught first; widely called _the simplest_ sorting algorithm.
- **Selection sort** — also very simple (select min and swap); commonly described as easy to understand/implement. 
- **Insertion sort** — still beginner-friendly (card-sorting analogy) and straightforward to implement.
- **Merge sort** — conceptually clear but needs recursion + merging (extra buffer), so a step up in complexity.
- **Quick sort** — efficient in practice, but harder for beginners due to pivot choice/partitioning and tricky worst cases.
