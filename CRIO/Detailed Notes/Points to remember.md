- DP(Dynamic Programing) = break down → solve once → store → reuse.
	- Everyday Analogy
		Think of **homework**:
		- Naive recursion = You forget your previous answers, so you solve the same question again and again.
		- DP = You keep a notebook of solved questions. Next time, just look it up instead of solving from scratch.
- Dynamic Programming (DP) is just a **problem-solving technique**. 
- If a big problem can be broken into **smaller overlapping subproblems**, we solve each small one **once**, and then reuse that solution. So instead of doing the same work again and again (like in naive Fibonacci), we **store results** and build on them.
