### Important Points:
- All Git related commands start with the `git` keyword.
- All the folders are called as repositories in the GIT.
- [History of GIT](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-A-Short-History-of-Git)
- [Branches in GIT](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches)
- A branch represents an independent line of development. Branches serve as an abstraction for the edit/stage/commit process. You can think of them as a way to request a brand new working directory, staging area, and project history.
-  It's important to understand that branches are just pointers to commits. When you create a branch, all Git needs to do is create a new pointer, it doesn’t change the repository in any other way.


### Story:

There are 


After Installing git we need to set up the git in laptop for it we need to provide:
- **User name**
- **Email**
- **Default branch**
- Git LFS is installed (optional)
- Credential manager is active (for saving your GitHub/Azure login)

We have to use the below commands in order:

| Steps | Command                                                       | Description                       |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 1.    | git config --global user.name "Raghavendra0416"               | Set User Name                     |
| 2.    | git config --global user.email "raghavendra.workin@gmail.com" | Set Mail                          |
| 3.    | git config --global init.defaultBranch main                   | Set default branch as "main name" |
| 4.    | git config --list                                             | To check if every thing is set    |
Now We are ready to use GIT.
Now the Main Branch is created. 


| Steps | Process                                                                               |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|       | Now you need to create folder/directories in the local                                |
|       | Initialize a new Git repository in your project/ Clone the code if already in the git |
