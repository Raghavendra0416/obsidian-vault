**1. SDLC**  
Software Development Life Cycle — process of planning, creating, testing, and deploying software in defined stages (e.g., Requirement Analysis → Design → Development → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance).

**2. Roles in IT Industry**
- **Client / Stakeholder** – Provides requirements & approves deliverables.
- **Business Analyst** – Gathers and documents requirements.
- **Project Manager** – Plans, assigns tasks, manages timelines.
- **Solution Architect** – Designs system architecture.
- **Developers** – Write and maintain code.
- **Testers / QA Engineers** – Test and validate software.
- **DevOps / SysAdmins** – Handle deployments, servers, CI/CD.
- **Support Team** – Maintains and fixes post-release issues.

Hierarchy & Work Flow: Client → Management (PM/Architect) → Technical Teams → Testing → Delivery.  
Projects come via bids, tenders, direct contracts, or product roadmaps.

**3. Key Software Components (for an application)**
- **Frontend (UI/UX)**
- **Backend (APIs, Business Logic)**
- **Database**
- **Authentication & Authorization**
- **Integrations (APIs/3rd party services)**
- **Infrastructure (Servers, Cloud)**
- **Security Components**
- **Testing Frameworks**
- **Deployment & Monitoring Tools**

##### SDLC(Software Development Life Cycle) Notes
For detailed explanation - [[SDLC(Software Development Life Cycle)]]

Product Manager will take the idea. and she will work on some requirements like if the feature is needed, should the video call also be recorded. and some other requirements.

Six Step Strategy
1. Understand the problem
2. Design test data / test cases (input and expected output)
3. Derive the solution - solve the problem (write pseudo code)
4. Test the solution (against the test data/test cases)
5. Write the program/code (using Java or JS)
6. Test the code (resolve errors and debug if required)


##### QUIZ 1:
1. There is a server issue - who will look into it first?
2. Will you do QA automation for experimental features? Why/Why not?
3. Who decides what feature to be built?
4. Who drives the stand up everyday?
5. If you are blocked on someone, who can you get help from?
6. Users are finding it hard to read some text in the UI - who should fix it?
7. How are Software engineering teams structured?
8. What are the roles and responsibilities of the people involved?
9. How are product features launched?'
10. How to approach a coding problem?
11. How to design test cases for problems?**

QUIZ 2:
1. How are websites built?
2. What are the different frontend technologies?
3. What does APIs and JSON mean?
4.  How to write pseudo code?
5. How to test your code?
6. What is the difference between HLD and LLD? **High Level Design** & **Low Level Design (LLD)**
7. What are data structures and algorithms?
