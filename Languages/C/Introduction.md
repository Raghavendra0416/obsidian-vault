##### What is #include:
- It is a preprocessor directive used to include external files or libraries into a program before the compilation process.
- It allows access to standard library functions (like `stdio.h` for input/output operations) or user-defined header files containing function declarations, macros, and data structures.
- The directive can include system files using angle brackets (`<>`) or custom files with double quotes (`""`).

##### What are Header Files:
- A file that typically contains declarations for functions, macros, constants, and data types that are used in a program.
- These files have the `.h` extension and are included in C source files using the `#include` directive.
- Header file names are case sensitive
- Two ways to # include header files in a program:
	- Using angle brackets(# include<Jason>).-system
     - Using angle Double quotes(# include "Jason"). - userdefined
        tells the preprocessor to first look in the current directory.
