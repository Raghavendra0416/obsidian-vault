### 1. **Tic-Tac-Toe Game (with AI)**

- **Skills you'll learn**: Object-oriented programming, arrays, recursion, AI (Minimax algorithm).
- **Concepts**: Create a basic version of Tic-Tac-Toe and then implement an AI that can play against the user. The AI will need to make strategic decisions, and you'll have to think about how to use a game tree and recursion to evaluate possible moves.

### 2. **Expense Tracker**

- **Skills you'll learn**: File handling, data persistence (using text files or databases), basic UI (using JavaFX or Swing).
- **Concepts**: Build a program where users can input their expenses and income and then view a breakdown of their finances. You can add features such as category-based tracking, date-based filtering, and monthly summaries.

### 3. **Library Management System**

- **Skills you'll learn**: CRUD operations, object-oriented programming, file handling or databases (SQL).
- **Concepts**: This project will help you get familiar with managing data in a structured way. You can allow users to add new books, borrow and return books, and view available books. You can extend this to include user roles, book reservations, and overdue fines.

### 4. **Weather Application (with API Integration)**

- **Skills you'll learn**: Working with external APIs, JSON parsing, exception handling.
- **Concepts**: Build a weather application that fetches data from an external weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) and displays current weather details based on the user's input (e.g., city name). You’ll need to handle API requests, parse JSON data, and display results.

### 5. **Simple Chat Application**

- **Skills you'll learn**: Sockets, multithreading, network programming.
- **Concepts**: Develop a client-server chat application. This will help you understand networking concepts, including how to establish a connection between clients and servers, handle multiple clients simultaneously (using threads), and send messages over a network.

### 6. **To-Do List Application**

- **Skills you'll learn**: CRUD operations, file handling, user input validation.
- **Concepts**: Build a to-do list where users can add, remove, and mark tasks as completed. You can add features like setting due dates, priorities, and sorting tasks by different criteria.

### 7. **Number Guessing Game with Difficulty Levels**

- **Skills you'll learn**: Random number generation, loops, user input handling.
- **Concepts**: Create a number guessing game where the program randomly selects a number, and the user has to guess it. Add difficulty levels with varying ranges for the number, and you can include features like counting the number of guesses.

### 8. **Banking System**

- **Skills you'll learn**: Object-oriented programming, file handling, exception handling.
- **Concepts**: Implement a simple banking system where users can create accounts, deposit/withdraw money, check balance, and transfer money between accounts. You can use file handling to store user data and account details.

### 9. **Online Quiz System**

- **Skills you'll learn**: File handling, user input validation, collections.
- **Concepts**: Design an online quiz application where users can answer multiple-choice questions. The system can give feedback on correct/incorrect answers and display the score at the end. You can store questions and answers in a file or database.

### 10. **Maze Solver (Pathfinding Algorithm)**

- **Skills you'll learn**: Algorithms (e.g., Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search), recursion, graphs.
- **Concepts**: Create a program that takes a maze and finds a path from the starting point to the end point. This can be done by implementing algorithms like BFS or DFS, which will help you understand graph traversal techniques.

### 11. **Student Grade Management System**

- **Skills you'll learn**: Arrays, classes, object-oriented principles, file handling.
- **Concepts**: Build a system where users can enter student data (name, grades, etc.), and the program calculates and displays averages, highest and lowest grades, and rankings. You can also store and load student data from files.
