### What is OOPs?

- Opps is a programming paradigm( the classification, style or way to solve a problem using some programming language) based on concepts of objects.

#### What are the principals of OOPs?

 - Inheritance
 - Encapsulation
 - Polymorphism
 - Abstraction

   Why Class & objects are not considered as principals?
   Ans. Class and Objects are more like the building blocks that enable the principles of OOP to function. not considered _principles_ because they do not represent _how_ objects interact or are structured within the system. They serve as the **mechanisms** that bring the OOP principles to life.
#### Is Java Object Oriented language or Object based language? and what is the diff?

- Object oriented language: if it was able to inherit the objects of another objects then it is OOP.
- Object based language: in this there will be objects, but we cannot inherit the properties to another object. example: VB.
- **Java as an Object-Oriented Language**: Java is **fully object-oriented** because it supports all four core principles of OOP: inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction. It uses classes and objects as the central structure of its design, and even allows primitive data types to be treated as objects with features like **autoboxing**.

- **Object-Based Language**: An object-based language may allow you to create and use objects but lacks full support for OOP principles like inheritance and polymorphism. **JavaScript** is an example (in its early versions), where objects could be created, but there was no native support for inheritance (though it now supports prototype-based inheritance).
