Here’s a realistic estimate based on typical learning curves for someone with **technical experience (like in RPA)**, aiming to **switch into Java full-time roles**.

## 🕒 Estimated Time to Achieve All Necessary Goals:

| Task                                                              | Time Estimate                | Notes                                                            |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Learn Core Java (OOP, collections, Java 8, exceptions, streams) | 3–4 weeks (20–30 hours/week) | Use free/paid platforms like Java Brains, CodeWithMosh, or Udemy |
| ✅ Learn Spring Boot + REST APIs                                   | 3–4 weeks                    | Focus on building actual APIs                                    |
| ✅ Build 3–4 Java projects with Spring Boot                        | 4–6 weeks                    | Includes design, coding, testing, deployment                     |
| ✅ Learn basic MySQL/PostgreSQL + integrate with Spring Boot       | 1 week                       | Only basics: schema design, CRUD, joins                          |
| ✅ Learn JUnit + Mockito + write tests                             | 1 week                       | Add tests to your projects                                       |
| ✅ Create GitHub portfolio + resume                                | 1 week                       | Includes good README files and project structure                 |
| ✅ Take a certification (optional)                                 | 1–2 weeks of prep            | Oracle Java OCA or Spring certification                          |

### 🧠 Total Time Needed (If Focused):

- **Part-time (2–3 hours/day):** ~3.5 to 4.5 months
    
- **Full-time (6–8 hours/day):** ~6 to 8 weeks

## 🎯 Fast-Track Plan (If You Have 2–3 Months):

Here’s a condensed 10-week schedule if you’re serious and can dedicate 15–20 hours per week:

|Week|Focus Area|
|---|---|
|1|Core Java basics: OOP, data types, conditions, loops, arrays|
|2|Java collections, exception handling, file I/O|
|3|Java 8: streams, lambdas, functional interfaces|
|4|Spring Boot basics, REST APIs|
|5|Project 1: CRUD app with Spring Boot & MySQL|
|6|Project 2: Auth + API + Docker|
|7|Project 3: Microservice-style app or blog system|
|8|Testing: JUnit, Mockito + project refinements|
|9|GitHub setup, documentation, LinkedIn update, mock interviews|
|10|Resume writing, apply to jobs, and practice interviews|

## 🔥 Tips to Save Time

- Use **templates and boilerplate** for Spring Boot setup.
    
- Reuse modules across multiple projects (e.g., login/auth).
    
- Focus more on **understanding** than memorizing.
    
- Pick **real-world problems** you care about to keep motivation high.
    
- Use **ChatGPT or Stack Overflow** when stuck to speed up debugging.
