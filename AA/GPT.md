#### API:
- An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. Developers use APIs to integrate external services, access data, or add functionality to their own applications without having to build everything from scratch.
#### Post Man:
- Postman is a popular API testing and development tool that allows developers to send requests, test responses, and debug APIs. It simplifies the process of working with APIs by providing an intuitive interface for testing, documenting, and automating API workflows.

#### Understand:
- Post Man application should be installed to work on API's
- To use Open AI API, we should login to chatgpt(OpenAI)
- To use Open AI(Op-AI..i.e shortcut) API in postman, we need to use Op-AI API key.
	- The key can be found in Op-AI Documentation
- The API Code will be written in JASON
- To use Chat GPT AP, we need to call endpoint
	- it can be found in documentation/chat/create chat compilation URL.
- We have different models in which can generate 
	- **DALL·E** is an example of an API used for generating images from text prompts, which is part of OpenAI's suite of models.
	- **DALL·E** enables the generation of images from text, **Whisper** can handle tasks related to audio, such as transcribing spoken words.
