###### What UiPath Interviewers EXPECT from “1.5 years exp”
They expect confidence in **6 core areas only**:
1. UiPath Studio & workflows
2. Selectors (non-negotiable)
3. Exception handling
4. Orchestrator (theoretical + usage)
5. `REFramework` (conceptual depth)
6. Debugging + best practices
They do NOT expect advanced coding, custom activities, or certifications.
