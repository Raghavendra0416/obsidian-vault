To summarize your situation:

- You **have 3 years of total experience**, but **not in Java**.
    
- You’re currently **learning Java** and plan to **position yourself as a Java developer with 3 years of experience** in your next job.
    
- You want to **prepare achievements** that match that level and make your transition credible.
    

That’s absolutely doable, but you’ll need to **bridge the gap** with practical, demonstrable skills and strategically build a **portfolio that sells your story**. Here’s a detailed plan:

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step Plan to Make Yourself Interview-Ready as a "3-Year Java Developer"

### 🎯 1. **Position Your Past Experience Smartly**

Even if your previous work wasn’t in Java, think about:

- **Tech-agnostic experience**: problem-solving, software logic, automation logic, debugging, system integration.
    
- Tools like Automation Anywhere may use scripting, APIs, data structures — all transferable skills.
    

**On your resume**, you can say:

> “3 years of experience in automation and process development, recently focused on enterprise backend development using Java and Spring Boot.”

Let your **"Java developer with automation background"** positioning be your niche.

### 🛠 2. **Build a Java Portfolio to Match 3 Years of Experience**

You'll need to **simulate 3 years of Java experience** with:

#### 🔹 **3–4 Realistic Projects** using:

- **Java 8+**
    
- **Spring Boot**
    
- **REST APIs**
    
- **MySQL/PostgreSQL**
    
- **Maven**
    
- **JUnit for testing**
    

✅ Project ideas:

1. **Employee Management System** (CRUD app with authentication)
    
2. **E-commerce Product Catalog API**
    
3. **Todo app with JWT Auth & Spring Security**
    
4. **Blog Platform with user roles and comments**
    

Push them to **GitHub** and deploy one on **Render or Railway** for demo.

---

### 🧪 3. **Prove Skills Through Tests or Certifications**

Certifications help fill trust gaps.

✅ Recommended:

- **Java SE 11 Certification (Oracle OCAJP)** – if time allows.
    
- **Spring Professional Certification** (optional but great).
    
- **LinkedIn Skill Assessments** (Java, SQL, OOP) — they’re fast and visible.

### 📄 4. **Build a Resume that Reflects Realistic Java Work**

Don't fake it — instead, **simulate realistic projects** and describe them in a way that shows understanding and delivery.

Example entry on resume:

> **Backend Developer (Java/Spring Boot)**  
> _Freelance / Self-initiated Projects (Jan 2024 – Present)_
> 
> - Designed and developed RESTful APIs using Spring Boot and JPA.
>     
> - Integrated MySQL database and implemented JWT-based authentication.
>     
> - Wrote unit and integration tests using JUnit and Mockito.
>     
> - Deployed application using Docker on Railway.
>     

---

### 🧠 5. **Be Ready for Java Interview Questions**

Study **Java interview topics** at a 3-year level:

- Core Java: OOP, multithreading, collections, streams, exception handling
    
- Java 8 features
    
- Spring Boot and REST API development
    
- SQL and database design
    
- Basic JUnit & testing
    
- JSON, HTTP, API status codes
    

👉 I can give you a **study checklist** or mock questions if you'd like.

---

### 🔄 6. **Address the Experience Gap If Asked**

If an interviewer digs into your history:

- Don’t lie — instead, say something like:
    

> “My career started in RPA/automation, where I gained strong programming logic and system design skills. Over the past year, I’ve fully transitioned into backend development using Java and Spring Boot and have built multiple projects to reflect my skills.”

This sounds honest, confident, and focused on **what you can do**, not what you lack.
