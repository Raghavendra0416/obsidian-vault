Think of it like a mini **Udemy + LeetCode + Khan Academy** combined:
### **Main Pages/Sections:**

1. **Landing Page** (Home)    
    - Hero section with search functionality
    - Featured courses carousel
    - Statistics dashboard (total users, courses, etc.)
2. **Course Catalog**
    - Filter/sort courses (by difficulty, category, rating)
    - Search with debouncing
    - Card-based layout
3. **Course Detail Page**
    - Video player mockup
    - Course curriculum (expandable sections)
    - Progress bar
    - Review/rating system
4. **Code Playground**
    - Interactive code editor
    - Algorithm visualizer
    - Run test cases
    - Submit solutions
5. **Quiz Section**
    - Multiple choice questions
    - Timer functionality
    - Score calculation
    - Results with explanations
6. **User Dashboard**
    - Progress tracking (charts/graphs)
    - Certificates earned
    - Learning streak calendar
    - Bookmarked courses
7. **Profile Page**
    - User settings
    - Achievement badges
    - Activity history

## ✅ What Needs to Be Done (Step-by-Step)

### **Phase 1: Setup & Structure** (Day 1)

```
☐ Create folder structure
☐ Setup index.html with navigation
☐ Create base CSS (variables, reset, typography)
☐ Setup main.js with routing logic
```

### **Phase 2: Data Layer** (Day 2)

```
☐ Create courses.js - array of course objects
☐ Create users.js - user data structure
☐ Create quizzes.js - quiz questions array
☐ Create problems.js - coding challenges
☐ Setup localStorage helper functions
```

### **Phase 3: Core Pages** (Day 3-5)

```
☐ Landing page with hero section
☐ Course catalog with filtering (filter, map, sort)
☐ Course detail page (nested objects, destructuring)
☐ User dashboard (reduce, data visualization)
```

### **Phase 4: Interactive Features** (Day 6-8)

```
☐ Search with autocomplete (string methods, closures)
☐ Quiz system (timer, score calculation, conditionals)
☐ Code editor (textarea, syntax validation)
☐ Algorithm visualizer (recursion, sorting, animations)
```

### **Phase 5: Advanced Logic** (Day 9-10)

```
☐ Progress tracking (time complexity O(n))
☐ Sorting/filtering with different algorithms
☐ Binary search for course search
☐ Two-pointer technique for recommendations
☐ Sliding window for "Recently Viewed"
```

### **Phase 6: Polish** (Day 11-12)

```
☐ Responsive design (mobile-first)
☐ Animations & transitions
☐ Dark/light theme toggle
☐ Error handling & validation
```

## 📊 How Your Concepts Are Used

|**Concept**|**Where Used**|
|---|---|
|Variables, Data Types|Throughout - storing user data, course info|
|Operators, Conditionals|Quiz scoring, form validation, user roles|
|Loops|Rendering course lists, quiz questions|
|Functions|Modular code for filtering, sorting, searching|
|**Arrays**|Course catalog, quiz questions, user progress|
|**Array Methods**|`filter` courses, `map` to cards, `reduce` for stats|
|**Objects**|Course data, user profiles, quiz structure|
|Array of Objects|Main data structure for courses/users|
|Spread/Rest|Copying data, merging course modules|
|Destructuring|Extracting course properties for display|
|Closures|Timer functions, private data in modules|
|Recursion|Course tree structure, file system, backtracking|
|**Algorithms**|Sorting courses, binary search, recommendations|
|Time/Space Complexity|Performance optimization notes|

## 🔥 Sample Data Structure

```javascript
// courses.js
const courses = [
  {
    id: 1,
    title: "JavaScript Masterclass",
    instructor: "John Doe",
    category: "Programming",
    difficulty: "Intermediate",
    rating: 4.7,
    enrolled: 1523,
    price: 49.99,
    thumbnail: "path/to/image",
    modules: [
      { id: 1, title: "Introduction", duration: "15min", completed: true },
      { id: 2, title: "Variables & Data Types", duration: "30min", completed: false }
    ],
    description: "Learn JavaScript from scratch...",
    tags: ["javascript", "web-development", "frontend"]
  },
  // ... more courses
];
```
