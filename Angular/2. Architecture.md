Angular App - one or more modules
Modules - One or more component and services. Module consist of "Component" & "Services".
Components - HTML + CSS
Services - Business Logic
Modules interact and render the view in the browser.

#### 1) Modules (`NgModules`)
- Think of **Modules** as **containers** that group related parts of the app.
- Example: `AppModule` is the main module, and there can be feature modules like `AdminModule`.

#### 2) Components
- **Components build the UI** (what you see on the screen).
- Each component has:
    - **HTML template** (view)
    - **TypeScript class** (logic/data)
    - **CSS styles** (design)

#### 3) Directives
- **Directives change how HTML behaves**.
- Examples shown:
    - `*ngIf` → show/hide elements
    - `*ngFor` → loop and create list items
    - `ngClass/ngStyle` → apply CSS dynamically

#### 4) Templates & Data Binding (center block)
This is how Angular connects component data to the HTML:
- `{{ }}` **Interpolation** → display data in HTML
- `[property]` **Property binding** → set HTML attributes using data
- `(event)` **Event binding** → handle clicks, input, etc.

This block is shown in the center because it connects UI + logic.

#### 5) Services
- **Services keep business logic and API logic** outside components.
- Components call services when they need data or common logic.

#### 6) Observables (RxJS) + HTTP Client
- Angular uses `HttpClient` to call APIs.
- The API results often come as **Observables** (RxJS), which is Angular’s common way to handle async data.

#### 7) Dependency Injection (DI)
- DI is how Angular **provides services to components automatically**.
- So instead of writing `new Service()`, Angular injects it for you.
- This makes code clean and easy to test.

#### 8) Routing
- Routing connects **URL paths** to components.
- Example:
    - `/home` → HomeComponent
    - `/products` → ProductsComponent

#### Overall flow (simple)
1. User interacts with the UI (component)
2. Component uses **data binding** to update the view
3. Component calls a **service**
4. Service may call **HTTP API**
5. Data comes back through **Observable**
6. UI updates automatically
