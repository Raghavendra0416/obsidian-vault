### Hook:
A Hook is a special function provided by React that lets you use React features like state and lifecycle methods in functional components.

Hooks cannot be used in class components. Hooks only work in functional components. Class components use `this.state` and `this.setState()` for state management instead of Hooks.

Hooks always start with the word 'use' - like `useState` and `useEffect`

The most common Hook is `useState`, which lets you add state (data that can change) to your functional component. When you use `useState`, React automatically re-renders your component when the state changes.

Why hooks can only be used in functional components?
Hooks were specifically designed to work with functional components. Class components already have their own way of managing state and lifecycle methods, so they don't need Hooks.

It can be used in login forms, display error messages: This is given at the last.

### Simple Example:

```JavaScript
import { useState } from 'react'; // ← Importing the Hook from React

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // ← Using React's Hook
// React gives you back two things: 
// 1. count (a variable with value 0) 
// 2. setCount (a function to update count)

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

##### What is Hook in the above code?
```JavaScript
const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // ← Using React's Hook
```

##### How `setCount` becomes function?
Because of `useState` is assigned to it and `useState` is a react hook which sets count to 0 and `setCount` as function. 

##### Why do we need to use `useState` instead of variable?
For Variable: When you click, count changes but the screen doesn't update!
For `useState`: When you click, React updates the screen automatically!
Regular variables don't tell React anything changed, but `useState` does!

##### Can we not use regular variables in React?
The Rule:

| **Use**                               | **When**                                             |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Regular variable** (`const`, `let`) | Value never changes OR doesn't need to update the UI |
| **State** (`useState`)                | Value changes AND needs to update the UI             |

##### What happens inside useState()? 
`useState()` is a built-in React function that:
- Creates a place in memory to store your value
- Returns an array with exactly **2 items**:
    - Item 0: the current value
    - Item 1: a function to update that value
```javascript
// Behind the scenes, useState does something like this:
function useState(initialValue) {
  let value = initialValue;  // Store the value
  
  function setValue(newValue) {
    value = newValue;
    // Tell React to re-render the component
  }
  
  return [value, setValue];  // Return array with 2 items
}
```
##### How does `setCount` become a function?
When you write:

javascript

```javascript
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

This is called **array destructuring**. You're unpacking the array:

javascript

```javascript
// What useState returns:
[0, function]

// You're taking those out:
const count = 0;           // First item
const setCount = function; // Second item
```


##### What if we add more variables are used inside the array, then will `useState` work as expected?
**It will cause an error or unexpected behavior!**
`useState()` only returns an array with **exactly 2 items**. If you try to destructure more:

```javascript
const [count, setCount, counted] = useState(0);
// count = 0
// setCount = function
// counted = undefined  ❌ (doesn't exist!)
```
**You can only take 2 things from `useState`.**

### Interview Answer

A Hook is a special function provided by React that lets you use React features like state and lifecycle methods in functional components.

Hooks always start with the word 'use' - like `useState` and `useEffect`.

The most common Hook is `useState`, which lets you add state (data that can change) to your functional component. When you use `useState`, React automatically re-renders your component when the state changes.


For example, `useState` returns two things: the current state value and a function to update it.
```javascript
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
// count is the state variable
// setCount is the function to update it
// 0 is the initial value
```

We use Hooks instead of regular variables because regular variables don't trigger React to re-render the component when they change. Hooks tell React to update the UI.

### Real-World Example: Login Form

This is what almost every company uses on their website:
```javascript
import { useState } from 'react';

function LoginForm() {
  const [email, setEmail] = useState('');
  const [password, setPassword] = useState('');
  const [errorMessage, setErrorMessage] = useState('');
  
  const handleLogin = () => {
    if (email === '' || password === '') {
      setErrorMessage('Please fill in all fields');
    } else {
      // Send login request to server
      setErrorMessage('');
      console.log('Logging in with:', email, password);
    }
  };
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Login</h2>
      
      <input 
        type="email" 
        placeholder="Email"
        value={email}
        onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}
      />
      
      <input 
        type="password" 
        placeholder="Password"
        value={password}
        onChange={(e) => setPassword(e.target.value)}
      />
      
      <button onClick={handleLogin}>Login</button>
      
      {errorMessage && <p style={{color: 'red'}}>{errorMessage}</p>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

Why Hooks are used here:
1. **`useState` for email** - Stores what the user types in the email field
2. **`useState` for password** - Stores what the user types in the password field
3. **`useState` for errorMessage** - Shows error messages when login fails

Other Real Company Examples:

|**Feature**|**What Hook Does**|
|---|---|
|**Shopping Cart** (Amazon, Flipkart)|`useState` to store items in cart|
|**Search Bar** (Google, YouTube)|`useState` to store search text as you type|
|**Like Button** (Facebook, Instagram)|`useState` to track if post is liked|
|**Form Validation** (Any signup form)|`useState` to store and validate user input|
|**Show/Hide Menu** (Navbar)|`useState` to toggle menu open/close|
|**Dark Mode Toggle**|`useState` to track if dark mode is on/off|

Interview Answer:
**"In real-time projects, we use `useState` Hook for any user interaction that needs to update the UI - like form inputs, toggle buttons, shopping carts, or search bars. For example, in a login form, we use `useState` to store the email and password as the user types, and to display error messages when validation fails."**
