**Definition:** React is a "**JavaScript library**" used specifically for building user interfaces.
It primarily focuses on the "View" layer of an application.
And it is responsible for building UI(User Interfaces).
React is Declarative.

**Role:** It handles the "logic" and "structure" of your app. It allows you to create reusable components (like a search bar or a profile card) and manages how data changes on the screen without reloading the page.

Library:
A library is a collection of specific tools you can use whenever you need them. You decide when to call the library, what it should do, and where it fits into your project. You are in total control of the program's flow.

Framework:
A framework is a "blueprint" or a foundation for your application. It provides the house, and you just fill in the rooms. It tells _you_ where to put your code and calls your code when it’s ready. This is known as **Inversion of Control**.

#### Prerequisites:
HTML, CSS and JavaScript fundamentals (also includes: "This" keyword, filter, map, reduce) & ES6 Features
ES6 - {
Const & Let, Arrow Function, Template Literals, Default Parameters, Object Literals, Rest and Spread Operator, `Destructuring`  assignment.
}

#### Component:
A component is a reusable piece of code (function or class) that returns UI elements.
Like for example: if we take a web page, then: Header, Side Nav Bar, Main Content, Footer are the components.

A component can contain other components like: The root component can contain Components (Header, Side Nav Bar, Main Content, Footer). The "Root Component" is called the **"App Component"**
###### How are components used in Code?
For Example: Each component code is typically placed in its own JS file (or JSX file). The App Component is usually placed in the App.js file.

Definition of Component:
In React, a **component** is a reusable, independent piece of code that returns UI elements (typically JSX). Think of components as building blocks for your application - each component manages its own content, presentation, and behavior. For example, you might have a Button component, a Header component, or a User Profile component.

#### Component Types:
1. Stateless Functional Component
2. Stateful Class Component

###### 1. Stateless Functional Component:
- Consists of JS functions.
- They return HTML
- These are JavaScript functions that return JSX. They're simpler.
```JavaScript
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

// Or using arrow function syntax
const Welcome = (props) => {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
};
```

###### 2. Stateful Class Component
- Class extends Component class
- Render method returning HTML
- These are ES6 classes that extend `React.Component`. They were the primary way to create components with state and lifecycle methods before Hooks were introduced.
```Javascript
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}
```
Class components have lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`.

#### Functional vs Class Components

| **Aspect**                 | **Functional Components**                                             | **Class Components**                                                                  |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**             | JavaScript function that returns JSX                                  | ES6 class that extends `React.Component`                                              |
| **Syntax**                 | Simple function syntax                                                | Class syntax with render method                                                       |
| **Code Length**            | Shorter and simpler                                                   | More verbose                                                                          |
| **Props Access**           | Direct parameter: `function MyComponent(props)`                       | Using `this.props`                                                                    |
| **`this` keyword**         | Not needed                                                            | Required (can cause binding issues)                                                   |
| **State Management**       | Uses `useState` Hook                                                  | Uses `this.state` and `this.setState()`                                               |
| **Lifecycle Methods**      | Uses `useEffect` Hook                                                 | Uses `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, `componentWillUnmount`                |
| **Hooks Support**          | ✅ Yes (can use all Hooks)                                             | ❌ No (Hooks only work in functional components)                                       |
| **Code Reusability**       | Custom Hooks for logic reuse                                          | Higher-Order Components (HOCs) or Render Props                                        |
| **Return Statement**       | Direct return                                                         | Return inside `render()` method                                                       |
| **Performance**            | Slightly better (no class overhead)                                   | Slightly slower                                                                       |
| **Learning Curve**         | Easier for beginners                                                  | Requires understanding of classes and `this`                                          |
| **Current Recommendation** | ✅ Recommended (modern approach)                                       | Still supported but not preferred for new code                                        |
| **Example**                | `function MyComponent() { return <div>Hello</div>; }`                 | `class MyComponent extends React.Component { render() { return <div>Hello</div>; } }` |
|                            | Mainly responsible for creating UI                                    |                                                                                       |
|                            | If a code can be implemented using both, the use Functional Component |                                                                                       |

**Bottom Line:** Functional components with Hooks are now the standard in React development, but class components are still fully supported and commonly found in older codebases.
